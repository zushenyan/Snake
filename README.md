Snake
=====
A little project for practice programming skill.
Originally this was made for my university application, now I put it on the github as an memonto.

Start
=====
Download the snake.jar and run it.

Requirements
============
May need Java Runtime Environment 1.4 and above installed.

Control
=======
* press any key to start.
* press directions keys to move.

Goal
====
Eat the black node as much as you can.

Known Issue
===========
In this game's logic, growing longer is priority to moving forward, which means if you eat a black node near by your own tail, it may kill you by accident.
